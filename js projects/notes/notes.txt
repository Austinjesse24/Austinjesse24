notes for the js clock
In this code, we have a JavaScript function called updateClock that handles updating the time display on a webpage.
The function updateClock begins by getting the current date and time using new Date(). This creates a new Date object, 
named now, which stores the current date and time down to the second.
Next, we extract the hours, minutes, and seconds from now. We use JavaScript's getHours(), getMinutes(), and getSeconds() 
methods to retrieve these values.
To make sure each time value is always two digits, we use padStart(2, '0'). This adds a "0" to the beginning of any single-digit number.
 For example, if the seconds are "5," it will be formatted as "05."
We then combine hours, minutes, and seconds into a single string in the format HH:MM:SS using template literals. This final time string 
is displayed in the HTML element with the id clock.
After defining the updateClock function, we call it once initially to display the time immediately when the page loads.
Lastly, we set an interval using setInterval(updateClock, 1000). This calls updateClock every 1000 milliseconds, or one second, to keep 
the clock updating in real time.
